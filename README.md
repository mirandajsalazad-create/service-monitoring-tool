# Service Monitoring Tool

A Python-based tool that simulates a service monitoring system using object-oriented design.
The program models services with status and load metrics and generates a system-level report
to assess overall service health.

## Features
- Models services using Python classes
- Tracks service status and load values
- Identifies overloaded and offline services
- Generates a summarized system health report
- Demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts

## Technologies
- Python
- Git

## Purpose
This project was created to practice object-oriented programming in Python and to simulate
basic service monitoring logic similar to internal system health tools.
